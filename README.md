# Study on Identifying Rehoming Patterns in Different Dog Breeds
## Introduction
This study aims to identify rehoming trends for three different breeds of dogs – Rottweiler, Shih Tzu, and West Highland White Terrier – and deduce whether the average time taken for each breed to find a new home deviates from the hypothesized value of 27 weeks. A dataset comprising 159 dogs, including 97 Rottweilers, 25 Shih Tzus, and 26 West Highland White Terriers, was collected from animal shelters. The dataset includes variables such as rehoming duration, health status, breed, age, reason for surrender, and previous rehoming status.

## Objective
* Identify average rehoming times for each breed.
* Determine if the observed rehoming times deviate significantly from the hypothesized value of 27 weeks.
* Explore characteristics that could affect rehoming patterns.

## Data Design
* Sample Size: 159 dogs (97 Rottweilers, 25 Shih Tzus, and 26 West Highland White Terriers).
* Variables: Rehomed duration, visited duration, health status, breed, age, reason for surrender, and previous rehoming status.

## Conclusion
* The observed rehoming times were shorter than the hypothesized value of 27 weeks for all breeds.
* Rottweilers were adopted more frequently than other breeds, suggesting a potential relationship between breed and rehoming times.
